# ProductProjects

This repository documents my ongoing practice in product analytics and data-driven decision-making, using Python and Kaggle datasets to simulate real-world business scenarios.

I am proficient in **SQL** (earning the LeetCode SQL badge in a single day) and **Python**, and I bring a solid foundation in machine learning — showcased in my [Undergrad\_ML\_Projects](https://github.com/botuevaliliia/undergrad_ML_projects) — while focusing here on applying analytics to measurable product outcomes.

Previously, many of my product analytics projects were developed at work but not preserved. With the advent of AI assistants like GPT and modern Python libraries, I decided to refresh and sharpen my skills by creating this dedicated repository of business-oriented analyses.
These are intentionally **simple, focused projects**, meant to demonstrate clear thinking and applied skills rather than deep research or production-ready pipelines. I independently design, implement, and analyze each project myself, occasionally using AI to refine ideas, validate assumptions, or improve presentation — treating it as a collaborative assistant rather than doing the work for me.

## Completed Analyses

* **Funnel Analysis:** Identified drop-off points in a customer acquisition funnel and quantified conversion rates at each stage to recommend targeted optimizations.
* **A/B Testing:** Designed and analyzed a controlled experiment to assess the impact of a product change, providing statistically sound insights for decision-making.

## In Progress

* Propensity to Churn / Purchase Model
* Cohort and Retention Analysis + LTV
* Airbnb Case Study (Price Regression)
* Recommendation System
* User Segmentation & RFM Analysis
